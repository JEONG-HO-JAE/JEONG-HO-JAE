**Chapter 1   Preliminaries**
<br>

# 1.1 Reasons for studying concepts of PL
There are several reasons why we have to study concepts of PL. However, the three most important of them will be explained below.<br>
<br>
-Increased capacity to express ideas<br>
Programmers, in the process of developing software, are contrained. The language used in developing have limits on the kinds of control structures, data structures, and abstractions. Awarness of a wider variety of programming language features can reduce such limtations in software development.<br>
<br>
-Improved background for chossing appropriate languages<br>
Some languages are no longer used, and many features now available in programming languages were not widely known at the past. If the programmers were familiar with a wider range of languages and language contructs, they would be better able to choose the language with the features that best address the problem.<br>
<br>
-Increased ability to learn new languages<br>
Their are so many languages. This means that programmers need to continuously learn languages. The process of learning a new language will be difficult for someone who knows only one for two languages. However, when we understand the fundamental concepts of languages, we have a much easier time learning a new language.<br>
<br>

# 1.2 programming Domains
Computers have been applied to a myriad of different areas. It is difficult to list all of the areas, however, the books briefly discuss a few of the areas of computers applications. The contests are obvious, so I will skip it.<br>

# 1.4 Infuences on Language Design

## 1.4.1 Computer Architecture
Most of the popular languages have been designed around the prevalent computer architecture called **John von Neumann**. These languages are called **imperative languages**.<br>

The execution of programs on a von Neumann architecture computer occurs in a process called the fetch-execute cycle. In a von Neumann computer, both data and programs are stored in the same memory. The central processing unit is seperate from memory to the CPU. Therefore, instructions and data must be transmitted from memory to the CPU, and we call this process **fetch**. Then the control unit, CU, wil decode the instructions. When CU determine what action to be executed, the memory information needed at ALU will send to ALU. Finally ALU will execute the instructions and the result will move to memory.<br>

A functional, or applicative, language is one in which the primary means of computation is applying functions to given parameters. Programming can be done in a functional language withcout the kind of variables that are used in imperative languages, without assignment statments and without iteration. Although many computer scientists have expounded on the myriad benefits of functional languages, it is unlikely that they will displace the imperative languages until a non-von Neumann computer is designed that allows efficient execution of programs in functional languages.<br>
