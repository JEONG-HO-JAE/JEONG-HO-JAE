# 1. Protocol
Protocol is a syetem of rules for formatting and processing data. It allows two or more entities of a communications system to transmit infromation via any kind of a physical quantity. Computers communicate using protocals, such as IP, so we can regard the protocal as a common language for computers. The protocol defines the rules, syntax, sementics and synchronization of communication. Communications are performed in well-defined formats for exchanging various messages.<br>

# 2. OSI 7 Layer
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is an abstract representation of how the Internet works. It contains 7 layers, with each layer representing a different category of networking functions.

OSI 7 layer can devide to 2 layer. One is Data Flow layer, 1~4 layer. It has the role of transferring data well to the other party as the term implies. The other is Application layer, 5~7 layer. It is a layer that exists to provide useful services to users.<br>


## 2-1. physical layer
The first layer defines information related to physical connection as a physical layer. The focus is mainly on transmitting electrical signals (0 and 1). The main equipment of the first layer includes hub, repeater, cable, connector, transceiver, and tab.<br>

## 2-2. Datalink layer
The second layer collects electrical signals from the first layer and processes them in the form of data that we can recognize. In this layer, it check the departure and destination addresses, and also handles error correction from the physical layer. There are the Media Access Control (MAC) and the Logical Link Control (LLC) in this layer. In the networking world, most switches operate at Layer 2.<br>
