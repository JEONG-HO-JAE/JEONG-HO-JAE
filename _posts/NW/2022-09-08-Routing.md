# 1.1 What is an Addresses
In computer notwork, when we mention a network address, it usually means any logical or physical address that uniquely distinguishes a network node or device over a computer or telecommunications network. For example, there are data link layer: MAC addresses, network layer: IP address, and transport layer: port number.<br><br>

In Figure 1.2, MAC addresses allow networking devices to directily communicate with their intermediate neighboring devices at the data link layer. IP addresses are used for ent-to-end addressing an d multi hop routing on the internet. And finally, port numbers are used to identify which application on a host is to handle a received data packet.<br><br><br>

# 1.2 MAC Layer addresses
Media Access Control (MAC) address of a device is a unique identifier assigned to network interface controllers for communications at the data link layer of a network segment. <br><br>

# 1.3 Network Layer Address (IPv4)
It is clear that expanding business and social awareness will continue to increase public demand for access to resources on the Internet, where the IP address has played a crucial role in TCP/IP network infrastructure.<br><br>

# 1.3.2 Subnetting
Subnetting was introduce to overcome some of the problems that parts of the Internt were beginning to experience with the classful two-level addressing hierarchy. When an IP network is assigned more than one subnet mask, it is considered a network with "Variable Length Subnet Masks"<br><br>

Subnetting partitions the host number into two portions, in which it divides the standard classful host-number field into two parts - the subnet number and the host number on that subnet. Subnetting overcame the registered number issue by assigning each organization one network number from IPv4 address space. The organization was free to assign a distinct subnetwork number for each of its internal network. This allowas the organization to deploy additional subnets without needing to obtain an new network number from the Internet.<br><br>
Internet routers use only the network-prefix of the destinaion address to route packets to a subnetted environment. Routers within the subnetted environment use the extended network prefix to route packets between the individual subnets.<br><br>
