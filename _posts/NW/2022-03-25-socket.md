# 1. Packet
## 1-1. What is a Packet
A packet is a small segment of a larger message in networking. Data is divided into packets and these are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them. <br>
## 1-2. Why use packets
Theoretically, it could be possible to send data without dividing them into small packets. However, such an approach can trigger traffic. Let's see following examples. While the long line of bits passed over the wires between two computers, no third computer could use those same wires to send information. The solution about this problem is a "packet switching" network. Packet switching refers to the ability of networking equipment to process packets independently from each other. It also means that packets can take different network paths to the same destination, so long as they all arrive at the destination.  Thanks to it, packets from multiple computers can travel over the same wires in basically any order, and we can use multiple connections.
