# TCP

## - Definition
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport protocol that is used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets.<br>

## - Header
Let's see the TCP header.<br>

TCP wraps each data packet with a header containing 10 mandatory fields totaling 20 bytes (or octets). Each header holds information about the connection and the current data being sent. <br>

### - Source port, Destination port

These fields represent the origin and destination of the segment, each of which is assigned 16 bits. In this case, an IP address and a port number are required to determine the address of the origin and destination. IP addresses are allocated at the network layer and port numbers are assigned to TCP headers.<br>

### - Sequence Number & Acknowledgment number
