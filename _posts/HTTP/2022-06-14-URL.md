# URL Synatx
URLs provide a means of locating any resource on the Internet, but these resources can be accessed by different scheme, and URL syntax varies from scheme to scheme.<br><br>

But this not mean that each different URL scheme has a radically different syntax. Most URLs adhere to a general URL syntax.<br><br>

Most URL schemes base their URL syntax on this format:<br><br>
**\<scheme> : \// \<user> : \<pasword> @ \<host> : \<port> / \<path>; \<params>?\<query>#\<frag>**

## Scheme : what protocal to use
The shceme is really the main identifier of how to access a given resource; it tells the application interpreting the URL what protocal it needs to speak. As we are studying HTTP, let's focus on HTTP scheme.<br><br>

The scheme componet must start with alpabetic character, and it is sperate from the rest of the URL by the first ":" character. Scheme names are case-insensitive, so "http:// ~~ " and "HTTP:// ~~ " are equivalent.<br><br>

## Hosts and Ports
To find a resource on the Internet, an application needs to know what machine is hosting the resource and where on that machine it can find the server that has access to the desired resource. The host and port componetns of the URL provide these two pieces of information.<br><br>
![hostnameport](/assets/images/http/hostnameport.jpg)<br>
The host componet identifies the host machine on the Internet that has access to the resource. The name can be provided as a hostname or as an IP address. <br><br>
The port componet identfies the network port on which the server is listening. For HTTP, which uses the TCP protocol, the default port is 80.<br><br>

## Usernames and Passwords
Many servers require a username and password before you can access data. FTP severs are a common example of this. <br><br>
